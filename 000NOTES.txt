    * How do you get from the Generate thumbnails screen BACK to the edit asset screen?
    * On the generate thumbnails screen, what is the little arrow icon for on the right.  It doesn't do anything for me. (Nevermind.  I just didn't have enough prototypes to fill up the screen.  Would be nice to fix that so that it only shows when there is overflow.)
    * There's no "save state" or obvious UI response after you click on the crop button except for the thumbnail filling in which may be off screen if one scrolls down to hit crop.  I was working on an ehnancement but I'm stashing for now...
